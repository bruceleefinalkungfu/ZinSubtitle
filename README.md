# ZinSubtitle

Best subtitle modifier.
Change the subtitle delay and save it. Need ZinNew jar to be fully functional

First choose a subtitle it will prompt

"How much to subtract? or press P to process or C to choose another file"

If you write 30. It will subtract 30 seconds from all the subtitle time in the file

If you write -20. It will ad 20 seconds in every subtitle time.

To subtract 1 minutes 0 second and 250 millisecond. Use this. 1m0s250


**P to process** is used when you want to subtract or add the time but after say 5 minutes. Subtitles are working fine for first 5 minutes but after that it starts getting delayed then use **P**
